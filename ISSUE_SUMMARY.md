# Issue Summary - Agent Selector Layout Overflow

## Quick Overview

**Problem:** Bottom input field and submit button are pushed out of viewport after adding agent selector dropdown.

**Root Cause:** AgentSelector component placed outside Thread component, breaking Thread's 100vh viewport height contract.

**Status:** üî¥ CRITICAL - Feature non-functional until fixed

## The Mistake We Made

```tsx
// ‚ùå WRONG - What we did
<AgentProvider>
  <AgentSelector />    {/* ‚Üê Added OUTSIDE Thread */}
  <ThreadProvider>
    <StreamProvider>
      <ArtifactProvider>
        <Thread />       {/* ‚Üê Expects 100vh but doesn't get it */}
      </ArtifactProvider>
    </StreamProvider>
  </ThreadProvider>
</AgentProvider>
```

**Why it's wrong:**
- Thread is NOT a regular component - it's a **full-page layout manager**
- Thread uses `min-h-screen` (100vh) for its own internal layout
- Adding AgentSelector above it creates: 60px + 100vh = overflow
- Thread's sticky bottom input gets pushed below viewport

---

## The Original Structure

```tsx
// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Original repository
<ThreadProvider>
  <StreamProvider>
    <ArtifactProvider>
      <Thread />    {/* ‚Üê Occupies entire 100vh viewport */}
    </ArtifactProvider>
  </StreamProvider>
</ThreadProvider>
```

Thread component internally manages:
- Header area
- Scrollable messages
- Sticky bottom input
- Total height = 100vh

---

## Recommended Solution

**Move AgentSelector INSIDE Thread component**

Advantages:
- Respects Thread's layout architecture
- Thread can adjust its own height calculations
- Minimal risk of breaking other features
- Follows Thread's existing pattern for header content

Implementation location: `src/components/thread/index.tsx`

## Next Steps

1. **Read documentation:** Review both analysis files
2. **Understand Thread:** Read Thread component source (565 lines)
3. **Follow TODO:** Execute LAYOUT_FIX_TODO.md Phase 1-6
4. **Reference original:** Compare with https://github.com/langchain-ai/agent-chat-ui
5. **Test thoroughly:** Verify all success criteria

## Key Learning

When integrating with third-party UI components:

1. ‚úÖ **DO:** Understand component's layout expectations first
2. ‚úÖ **DO:** Check if component is a layout manager vs regular component
3. ‚úÖ **DO:** Reference original repository for patterns
4. ‚ùå **DON'T:** Assume all components follow typical React patterns
5. ‚ùå **DON'T:** Add content outside layout manager components

## Critical Path Forward

```
Phase 1: Investigation ‚Üí Phase 2: Design ‚Üí Phase 3: Implementation ‚Üí 
Phase 4: Testing ‚Üí Phase 5: Edge Cases ‚Üí Phase 6: Documentation
```

**Start with:** Reading the entire Thread component to understand its internal structure.

**DO NOT:** Make any code changes until Phase 1 is complete.
